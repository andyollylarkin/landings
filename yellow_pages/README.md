# DataForge — Yellow Pages Landing

This folder contains a lightweight landing scaffold built with HTML/CSS/JS and configured to run with Vite.

Files created:
- `index.html` — main landing page
- `src/style.css` — styles following the visual style guide
- `src/main.js` — small JS for interactions
- `assets/` — local assets (logo, hero placeholder)
- `package.json` & `vite.config.js` — simple vite-run config

How to run locally:

```bash
cd yellow_pages
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the shown URL (usually http://localhost:5173).

Notes:
- The design follows the provided visual style guide and uses local assets only.
- `structure.txt` was empty; I used the Page Section Order from the visual style guide as the landing structure.
