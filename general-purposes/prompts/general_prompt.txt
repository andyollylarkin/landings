**Icon:** ⏰ (Clock icon, 64px, orange color)

**Headline:** "Endless Manual Data Entry"

"Your team spends hours copying job postings, company details, and candidate information from LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor into spreadsheets. Every hour wasted on data entry is 4-6 lost prospect conversations or strategic analyses you could be conducting."

#### Card 2: Data Inaccuracy
**Icon:** ❌ (Error icon, 64px, red color)

- **Day 1:** 30-minute discovery call to understand requirements
- **Day 2:** Solution design and development
- **Day 3:** Testing and first data delivery
- **Day 4+:** Ongoing automated delivery

For complex multi-source projects, setup may take 5-7 days. We provide daily progress updates throughout."

---

#### FAQ 3: What if LinkedIn or Indeed changes their website?

**Answer:**
"That's exactly why you hire us instead of using DIY tools. We monitor all your data sources 24/7 and automatically update scrapers when platforms change. 

You'll never experience data downtime—our systems detect changes within hours and deploy fixes immediately. This ongoing maintenance is included in your service with no additional charges."

**Answer:**
"We guarantee 99.9% data accuracy. This means:
- Correct field mapping (job titles, salaries, locations)

- Valid contact information
- Properly formatted data structures

Every delivery includes quality assurance checks. If you find errors, we fix them immediately and credit your account. Our accuracy rate is validated through weekly audits across all client projects."

---

#### FAQ 5: What data sources can you scrape?

**Answer:**
"If it's publicly accessible online, we can scrape it. Common sources include:

- **Niche platforms:** Industry-specific job boards

We've successfully extracted data from 300+ different platforms for our clients."

---

#### FAQ 6: How much does it cost?

**Answer:**
"Pricing depends on your specific needs: data volume, number of sources, delivery frequency, and complexity. Typical ranges:
- **Small projects:** $500-2,000/month (1-3 sources, weekly updates)
- **Medium projects:** $2,000-8,000/month (5-10 sources, daily updates)
- **Enterprise:** $8,000+ /month (unlimited sources, real-time data)

We offer custom quotes after understanding your requirements. Most clients see 10X+ ROI within the first month by eliminating manual labor and accelerating decision-making.

**First-time clients:** We provide a discounted pilot project to demonstrate value before committing to ongoing service."

---

#### FAQ 7: Do I need technical knowledge to use DataForge?

**Answer:**
"No technical skills required. We handle all the complexity. You simply:
1. Tell us what data you need (in plain English)
2. Choose your delivery format (Excel, Google Sheets, database, API)
3. Receive clean, ready-to-use data automatically

We offer multiple delivery options:
- **Non-technical teams:** Data appears in Google Sheets or sent via email
- **Technical teams:** Direct API access or database integration

Our account managers guide you through setup with zero technical jargon."

---

#### FAQ 8: What if I need data from a protected or login-required site?

**Answer:**
"For sites requiring authentication, we can:
1. **Option A:** You provide login credentials (stored securely), we scrape on your behalf
2. **Option B:** We guide you through setting up authorized API access where available
3. **Option C:** We evaluate legal workarounds for publicly available data portions

We never engage in unauthorized access or credential compromise. Everything is done with proper authorization and documented consent."

---

#### FAQ 9: How do you handle CAPTCHAs and anti-bot systems?

**Answer:**
"We've developed specialized techniques to work with protected sites, including:
- Distributed proxy networks to avoid IP blocks
- Browser automation that mimics human behavior
- CAPTCHA-solving integrations (when legally appropriate)
- Adaptive rate limiting to avoid detection
- Fallback systems when primary methods fail

Unlike off-the-shelf tools that get blocked constantly, our success rate exceeds 99.5% across all platforms. We've been extracting data from heavily protected sites for 5+ years without interruption."

---

#### FAQ 10: What's your data security and privacy policy?

**Answer:**
"Your data security is our top priority:
- **SOC 2 Type II certified** infrastructure
- **End-to-end encryption** for all data transmission
